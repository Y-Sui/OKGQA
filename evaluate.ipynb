      "    \"The New Deal was a series of programs, public work projects, financial reforms, and regulations enacted by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the United States between 1933 and 1938 to rescue the U.S. from the Great Depression.\",\n",
      "    \"The New Deal included new constraints and safeguards on the banking industry and efforts to re-inflate the economy after prices had fallen sharply.\",\n",
      "    \"New Deal programs included both laws passed by Congress as well as presidential executive orders during the first term of the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt.\",\n",
      "    \"The programs focused on what historians refer to as the '3 R's': relief for the unemployed and for the poor, recovery of the economy back to normal levels, and reform of the financial system to prevent a repeat depression.\",\n",
      "    \"The New Deal produced a political realignment, making the Democratic Party the majority with its base in progressive ideas, the South, big city machines, the newly empowered labour unions, and various ethnic groups.\",\n",
      "    \"Republicans were split, with progressive Republicans in support but conservatives opposing the entire New Deal as hostile to business and economic growth.\",\n",
      "    \"The realignment crystallized into the New Deal coalition that dominated presidential elections into the 1960s and the opposing conservative coalition largely controlled Congress in domestic affairs from 1937 to 1964.\",\n",
      "    \"The Great Society was a set of domestic programs in the United States launched by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964 and 1965.\",\n",
      "    \"The term 'Great Society' was first referenced during a 1964 speech by Johnson at Ohio University, then later formally presented at the University of Michigan, and came to represent his domestic agenda.\",\n",
      "    \"The main goal of the Great Society was the total elimination of poverty and racial injustice.\",\n",
      "    \"New major federal programs that addressed civil rights, education, medical care, urban problems, rural poverty, and transportation were launched during this period.\",\n",
      "    \"Some Great Society initiatives were derived from earlier New Frontier proposals, which stalled during the Kennedy administration.\",\n",
      "    \"Johnson's success depended on his skills of persuasion, coupled with the Democratic landslide victory in the 1964 elections that brought in many new liberals to Congress.\",\n",

      "    \"The War on Poverty began with a $1 billion appropriation in 1964 and spent another $2 billion in the following two years.\",\n",
      "    \"The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 was designed by Commissioner of Education Francis Keppel.\",\n",
      "    \"The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 was signed into law on April 11, 1965, less than three months after it was introduced.\",\n",
      "    \"The Higher Education Facilities Act of 1963 was signed into law by Johnson a month after becoming president.\",\n",
      "    \"The Higher Education Act of 1965 increased federal money given to universities, created scholarships and low-interest loans for students, and established a national Teacher Corps.\",\n",
      "    \"The Social Security Act of 1965 authorized Medicare and provided federal funding for many of the medical costs of older Americans.\",\n",
